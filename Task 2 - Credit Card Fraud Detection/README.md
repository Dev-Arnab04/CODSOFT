# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is part of my internship at CODSOFT. It focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The model was trained on a real-world anonymized dataset.

## 📌 Objective
To classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using a supervised machine learning approach.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Isolation Forest
- ROC-AUC Evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset is highly imbalanced.
- Contains 284,807 transactions with 492 frauds.

## 📈 Key Features
- Data preprocessing (scaling, handling imbalance)
- Correlation analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- ROC Curve visualization
